# MealsTogo is my first major project using REACT NATIVE


#MealsToGo is a restaurant recommendation app that allows you to:

search for restaurants by city in a list view or map view,
see the restaurant menu,
order their special,
create a favorite restaurants list, and
update your profile picture.
